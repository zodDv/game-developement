# Sonar treasure hunt game in python

The game board has 900 spaces, and to make all these spaces manageable, we use the Cartesian coordinate system.

Locations on the board are stored in a list of lists in which the first index is the x-coordinate and the second index is the y-coordinate.

Data structures organised in this code makes possible to store complex concepts and most importantly are easily modifiable.

In this code we import the math module ehich make it possible to create an algorithm (lines 68 to 75)to determine closest distance to some point on the board. This is possible because math module has a square root function.
